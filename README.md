# Random Password Generator

## Description
An application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. It has a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes. As a class homework assignment, I was provided a functional HTML & CSS file along with a partially complete JS file.

The user will be promted to enter a length for their password. Enter a valid number (between 8 and 128) to begin. The input is validated to ensure value less than 8 or greater than 128 trigger a prompt to the user to input a valid password length.

The user will then be prompted to select which type of characters they want included in their password. They can choose to include uppercase characters, lowercase characters, special characters, and numbers. At least one type of character must be selected to generate the password. Selecting 'OK' will include that type of character in the password while selecting 'Cancel' will exclude that type of character from the password.

Once a valid password length has been given, and the character types selected, the applicaton generates a random passord based on the previous inputs. The password is displayed to the main screen. The password can be copied directly from the display box.
